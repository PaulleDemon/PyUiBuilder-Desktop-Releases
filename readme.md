## Note about desktop release
* The desktop version allows you to live preview and debug without having to download the code. More features will be added in the near future.
* Desktop app is only available for users on [paid plan](https://about.pyuibuilder.com/#pricing)

<b>Note: </b> The desktop app's are not [code signed](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Code_signing), because its expensive for me right now.

                    <b>What does this mean?</b>
                    <br>
                    On Mac and Windows, code signing is required, otherwise the firewall may block
                    some of the features, but it's completely safe to continue using as it has already 
                    been tested on Windows

                    <b>Will it be code signed in the future?</b>
                    <br>
                    Yes, as soon as I can afford it.
